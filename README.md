<h1> What does it do? </h1>
-This program automatically randomises a class' seating arrangement. <br>
-Each bench seats 2 students and the number of benches depend on the number of students. <br>
-The list of all students in the class are provided in the code in the form of an array.
<br>
<h1>How does it work?</h1>
-A loop pick 2 random items from the students list and adds it to a sub list <br>
-Each sub-list represents a bench. <br>
-The sub-list is pushed into a larger list called "positions" <br>
<br>
